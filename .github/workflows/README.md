## Required Secrets

To use these workflows, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Required for All Workflows
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)

### Required for Vercel Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

### Required for Azure Deployment
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Azure service principal credentials
- `AZURE_APP_NAME`: Azure App Service name
- `AZURE_PUBLISH_PROFILE`: Azure publish profile

### Required for SonarCloud
- `SONAR_TOKEN`: SonarCloud authentication token

### Optional
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Slack webhook URL for notifications

## Usage Examples

### Manual Workflow Triggering

```bash
# Trigger E2E tests manually
gh workflow run e2e-tests.yml

# Trigger dependency update check
gh workflow run dependency-update.yml

# Create a release manually
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v1.2.3 -f prerelease=false
```

### Local Testing

Before pushing changes, test your workflows locally:

```bash
# Test build process
make ci-build

# Test with our enhanced build script
./build.sh --clean --verbose

# Test E2E tests (requires running application)
make test-with-app
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

The workflows are designed to work across different environments:

- **Development**: E2E tests run on every PR
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment from develop branch
- **Production**: Manual deployment from main branch with releases

## Workflow Status Badges

Add these badges to your README.md:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/yourusername/CustomerSupportSystem/workflows/CI%20-%20Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)
![E2E Tests](https://github.com/yourusername/CustomerSupportSystem/workflows/E2E%20Tests/badge.svg)
![Security Scan](https://github.com/yourusername/CustomerSupportSystem/workflows/Security%20Scan/badge.svg)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**: Check the build logs in the Actions tab
2. **Test Failures**: Ensure the application can start properly
3. **Deployment Failures**: Verify secrets are configured correctly
4. **Permission Issues**: Check repository settings and token permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding this to any workflow:

```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

### Local Development

Use our build tools for consistent local development:

```bash
# Standard development workflow
make dev-setup    # Initial setup
make build        # Build everything
make run-web      # Start the application
make test-e2e     # Run E2E tests (in another terminal)

# CI simulation
make ci-verify    # Simulate CI pipeline locally
```
